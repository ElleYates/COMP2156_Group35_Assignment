Key principles of DevOps

DevOps implementation varies with each company, depending on their goals, processes, and even corporate cultures. We can, however, identify a number of core DevOps principles that most teams follow. The advantages of DevOps are Fostering a collaborative environment through communication, mutual trust, sharing of skills and ideas, and problem-solving.  

Establishing a culture of end-to-end accountability, in which the entire team is responsible for the outcomes and there are no “pointing fingers” between the “Dev” and “Ops” experts.  
Focusing on continual improvement based on customer input and evolving technologies in order to optimize product quality, cost, and delivery speed.  
Whenever possible, use automation to streamline and speed up development and deployment processes, as well as enhance efficiency and dependability.  
Providing a client-centric strategy with quick feedback loops to meet changing customer needs.  
Taking lessons from mistakes and fostering an environment where they can be turned into new opportunities.
